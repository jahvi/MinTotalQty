## Minimum Order Quantity

By default Magento lets us set the minimum quantity allowed in the shopping cart for individual items but this extension lets you set a minimum quantity for the whole order.

You can set specific order minimums for each customer group and use it with the default minimum product quantity option so you can control the limits on the product and order level.

### Features

- Set Minimum order quantity.
- Specify different minimums for each customer group.
- Works together with the default product minimum functionality.

### How to use

1. Go to System > Configuration > Catalog: Inventory > Stock Options
2. Add as many minimum quantities per customer groups as you need.
